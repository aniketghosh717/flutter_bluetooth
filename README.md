SHELMET : This project helps to reduce the number of road accidents .The system will alert the bike rider if any vehicle crossing the speed limit comes too close
while riding the bike.Our accident detection technology lets your helmet detect any accidents or impacts you may have, and immediately relay the
location and time of the incident to your emergency contacts
